# Video production

## Types of audio/video production projects

* Short-film
* Experimental film: [Examples on vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/categories/experimental)
* Documentary
* Podcast
* Audio tour or installation

If you are interested in creating an audio-focused project, it would be good to include some visual component such as imagery/video, or a user interface for accessing and distributing the work. Talk to your instructor for more ideas.

## Production requirements

Depending on the type of project, you may need more or fewer steps than what are listed here.

**Note:** For most projects, you will need access to high-end video and audio equipment, though a lofi aesthetic or concept realted to everyday devices could work well with phone cameras. Smartphone cameras limit you to very wide angle lenses, but filmakers like Stephen Soderbergh have shot feature films with them!

1. **Reccommended Gear**

   * DSLR camera — greater [depth of field](https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/) and lens customization than a camcorder.
   * Tripod — Required for most professional video work.

   * [Smartphone tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Joby-GripTight-Smartphone-Action-Flexible/dp/B075M7MK35) — If shooting with a phone, you can still get a tripod!

   * Shotgun \(hypercardiod microphone\) — Best for directional recording if your subject is speaking; Rode makes good ones for DSLR cameras.

   * Lighting: a [reflector board](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1016048-REG/raya_cr_51_42_5_in_1_collapsible_reflector_disc.html) or piece of white foamcore can reflect light towards your subject, but electric lights on stands are best for stationary indoor photography.
